## Getting Started
Get ready for fun! Follow instructions for real-time facial emotion recognition through your webcam. Let's go! ðŸš€ðŸ˜ƒ

## Instructions
Follow the [main file](fer_main.ipynb) for neural network training.

Files Structure:
- fer_main.ipynb - Tutorial to train the CNN
- fer_webcam.ipynb - Uses the pre-trained model to predict emotions via webcam
- model.json - Neural network architecture
- model.h5 - Trained model weights

## Prerequisites
Install these prerequisites before proceeding:
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install seaborn
pip3 install keras
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install plotly
pip3 install scikit-learn
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install opencv-python
```


### Method 1 : Using the built model 

No need to train from scratch! Just use fer_webcam.ipynb with pre-trained model.json and model.h5 to predict facial emotions real time on your webcam. Customize it for your needs! ðŸ¤©

### Method 2 : Start from scratch
Let's get started with building the model from scratch! Follow these steps:

Clone the repository using the command:  
```
https://github.com/ACM40960/project-22200226.git
```

Download and extract the dataset from the Kaggle link: 
```
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishpatel26/facial-expression-recognitionferchallenge
```
Download Haar Cascade classifier from this repository:
```
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
```

Run fer.ipynb and modify to your needs!


## Analysis & Findings
The classes in the dataset show imbalance,  where 'Happy' is predominant and 'Disgust' is minority.

## Our CNN Build Model and Model Summary
> :rocket: **Alert!** Buckle up, because the training process for our model takes around *14.1 hours*! :hourglass_flowing_sand:
* Utilizes 6 convolutional layers.
* Images resized to 48 x 48 before entering the first convolutional layer.
* Data augmentation techniques (such as rotations, shifts, and flips) are employed to enhance the model's ability to generalize
* Feature maps from convolutional layers go through Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) activation function.
* Includes batch normalization, dropout layers, early stopping, and ReduceLROnPlateau callback to counter overfitting.
* Output layer contains 7 units to classify the 7 emotion classes.
* Output layer uses softmax activation function for probabilistic class outputs.
* Optimizer: Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation (Nadam), which combines Adam and Nesterov Momentum.
